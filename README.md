# DRL_Algorithm
**This is a repository for DRL algorithms based on tf2.0.**
- Some classic algorithms of Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) will be presented. 
- I use Gym as a toolkit for developing and comparing DRL algorithms. 
- The programs are based on tensorflow 2.0.

## DRL algorithms have been presented:
- DQN
- DDQN
- PG
- A2C

***Some algorithms support both continuous and discrete actions. The agent for continuous action is defined as "xxx_agent_con.py"***.
