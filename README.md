# DRL_Algorithm
**This is a repository for DRL algorithms based on tf2.0.**
- Some classic algorithms of Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) will be presented. 
- I use Gym as a toolkit for developing and comparing DRL algorithms. 
- The programs are based on tensorflow 2.0.

## DRL algorithms have been presented:
- DQN
- DDQN
- PG
- AC
- A2C

------

*Note*:

1. **AC** and **A2C** have two kinds of agents. The difference is the training method for the critic network
2. Some algorithms support both continuous and discrete actions. The agent for continuous action is defined as "xxx_agent_con.py".
